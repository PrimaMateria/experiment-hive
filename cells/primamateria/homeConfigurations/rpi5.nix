# Raspberry Pi 5 was running Raspbian with Pure Nix. Some configurations that I
# couldn't write in Nix, I attempted to write as a bash configuration script. In
# addition to other installations, the configuration script also installed
# Docker and Docker Compose, which were used to run Traefik and services. The
# Raspberry Pi 5 was later replaced with a Beelink running full NixOS. Meanwhile
# this config was refactored but not evaluated so I am not sure if it is in
# working state.
